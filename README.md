# Shifty Jumper – Mini 2D Platform Game

This project is a personal practice work built to learn the basics of 2D game development in Unity and fundamental C# scripting concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose
To understand Unity’s core systems, 2D game logic, physics interactions, UI structure, and C# programming patterns through a small platformer project.

## 🕹️ How To Play
Right and left arrow keys allow the player to walk, and the space key is used for jumping.  
Your goal is to collect **30 coins** and reach the door to move to the next level.

There are enemies and spikes placed throughout the levels.  
If you collide with them, you will respawn at the beginning of the level and your **death counter increases by 1**.

You can see the coin amount, death amount, and whether the door is open through the **HUD** at the top of the screen.

The game contains **2 levels**.

## 📚 What I Have Learned?

### • Usage of Unity
Practical experience with the Unity interface, scene management, and basic workflow.

### • Understanding the Collider and Physics Systems with Rigidbody
Learning how colliders work, how collisions are detected, and how physics behaviors are applied with Rigidbody components.

### • Usage of Tilemap and Tile Palette
Understanding how to create 2D levels using Unity’s tilemap system and tile palette tools.

### • Usage of the Animator Tool
Implementing character animations using the Animator system, animation states, and transitions.

### • Understanding C# OOP Implementation in Games
Applying object-oriented programming principles to Unity game architecture.

### • Usage of C# Namespaces
Actively using the following namespaces:
- `UnityEngine`
- `UnityEngine.SceneManagement`
- `UnityEngine.UI`
- `TMPro`
- `UnityEngine.Audio`

### • Creating Main Menu and Pause Menu Using the UI System
Building user interface screens such as the Main Menu and Pause Menu with the Canvas/UI system.

### • Understanding How to Debug Your Game
Using Debug.Log, inspector monitoring, and runtime testing to identify and fix gameplay issues.
